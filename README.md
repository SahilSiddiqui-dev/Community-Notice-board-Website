# Community-Notice-board-Website
I recently built a "Community Notice Board" website using HTML, CSS, and JS for a residential society. It includes Announcements, Events, Buy/Sell/Rent, and Contacts. I added a simple admin panel for updates. The site is mobile-friendly, easy to use, low-maintenance, and promoted locally for community use.
